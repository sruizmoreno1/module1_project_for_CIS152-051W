	<h1>SERGIO RUIZ MORENO</h1>
	<h2>Photographer in the Making</h2>
	<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>My name is Sergio Ruiz Moreno and I'm a photographer major at Parkland College. I was born in Mexico, Guanajuato, Nuevo Leon and I moved here when I was two years old. When I was young I was interested in art right away, I drew a lot of weapons. As I got older I began taking more art classes and eventually taking my first film photography class in high school.<br>I fell in love with photography right away and now I'm working on getting an associates degree in photography. My dream goal is to make a photography business where I can charge a family depending on their financial amount (low-income families will pay a cheap price and high-income families will pay for a high price). I want to give everyone photos that will bring them cheerful memories.</p>
